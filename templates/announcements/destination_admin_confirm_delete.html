    workflow again, if you need to be added back to this destination.</p>
  {% else %}
    <p>You are removing yourself as an admin of {{ destination.subclass.name }}.
    There are no other admins configured, so this action will also delete this
    destination from the system. (It will not continue to receive any
    announcements.)</p>
    <p>If you want to add it again in the future, you will have to use the
    "Connect" workflow again.</p>
